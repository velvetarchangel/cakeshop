                <p>
                    Nestled in the heart of Sunnyside, BakeShop offers the charm and warmth of a European café.
                    We are proudly situated in the historic Vendome Block, a building that has served our neighbourhood for years.
                    We honour this tradition by supporting our community, through the use of local farmers and artisans.
                    From the heart of our kitchen come freshly prepared soups, sandwiches and binge worthy brunches.
                    All pastries are lovingly baked on premise every morning and our fresh bread is baked each day by our sister company Alforno Bakery & Cafe.
                    Indulge in a cup of organic fair trade coffee or a glass of wine. We are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner 7 days a week.
                </p>
